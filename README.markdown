# Ribernate #

This is basically a tilting-at-windmills exercise in whether or not we can bring an object-relational mapper to Ruby which:

1. Doesn't mix your data access methods into the same class as your business logic methods
2. Isn't a pain to wire up

Use at your own risk.

To see what end-user code will look like, check out [spec/ribernate_spec.rb](https://github.com/mortice/ribernate/blob/master/spec/ribernate_spec.rb).
